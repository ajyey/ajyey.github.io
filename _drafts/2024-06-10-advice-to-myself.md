This is a small list of of some things I would tell my younger self entering the workforce. I don't claim to be an expert today, but I do believe I've picked up on some things that would have been good for my younger self to know right at the start of his foray into the software engineering industry.

## 1. You Don't Need to Know Everything

When I first started studying computer science in college, I felt like I needed to know everything to land a job. Then when I started my first job, I felt like I needed to know every new technology and framework that was coming out to feel like a "real engineer". The reality is that you don't need to know everything.

That being said, I _do_ still think it's beneficial to have a surface level understanding of things across a couple of different areas within this field. Take a look at [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/) and you'll see that there's no shortage of areas within the field of software engineering to learn about.

In my opinion, this field is unique in the fact that it seemingly changes by the hour and new things to learn spring into existence _all of the time_. I believe it's important to cultivate a mindset of continuous growth and learning and think it equally important to know and accept that you won't know everything. That's okay.

## 2. Learn `git`

Before you learn anything, learn `git`. Not only is it by far the most popular tool for version control, [overtaking others by a large margin](https://openhub.net/repositories/compare), but it can (and will) save you a lot of headache throughout your career. **I never write code without version control.**

If you learn the basics of `git`, you'll be able to handle the following scenarios:

- Delete a file by accident? [You can get it back using `git checkout`](https://4ddig.tenorshare.com/windows-recovery-solutions/git-restore-deleted-file.html).

- Want to stash a small change to use (i.e. apply) later? [`git stash` is your friend](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-stash)

- Have a fancy new feature you want to work on without affecting existing stable code? [Create a new branch](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches) and work on that feature worry free.

These scenarios scratch the surface of what you can accomplish. You can spend months learning all the ins and outs of `git`, but at the very least, learn the basics. Learn how to commit changes, push and pull from a remote, work with branches, etc. The importance of version control cannot be overstated.

## 3. Prioritize Your Health

This one is likely the most important tidbit out of this list. Yes, even more important than knowing how to use `git`.

Working as an engineer can be remarkably sedentary. It's very easy to slip into a routine of sitting at a desk for 8+ hours a day followed by more sitting on the couch, thereby not moving much at all. When I find myself slipping into a routine like this, I feel noticeably worse. My body tightens up. My back starts hurting. General motivation quickly wanes.

The solution is consistent exercise. You have to get your body moving to combat the sedentary lifestyle that comes with being stuck in front of a computer a large portion of the day. You should be doing something everyday to get your heart rate elevated and your body sweating. Go to the gym and lift to failure or hit the stairmaster. Exercise daily no matter what in some way, shape, or form. No excuses. For bonus points, add a stretching and mobility routine.

As a bonus, I've found that not only do I feel much better when I'm exercising regularly, but I also tend to be much more motivated to excel in my work and personal projects. So not only will you be healthier, but you'll also trend towards being a better, productive engineer if that's your goal.

## 4. Don't Be Afraid to Say **No** <sub><sup>(within reason)</sup></sub>

This one is a little hard to do when you're fresh, possibly starting your first job, and don't know much.

I still think it's worth mentioning since saying "no" is an underutilized option and most people forget it's an option.

I wouldn't recommend flat out refusing to do something that your manager or team lead asks of you, but developing a "pushback" muscle as you gain more years of experience isn't a bad thing.

For example, I think being hit with an unrealistic deadline that would compromise quality is a good candidate for speaking up. Or maybe your team is using a specific technology for a task when a much better one exists. As a beneficial byproduct, conveying your (possibly) contradcitory thoughts can lead to constructive, productive discussion.

In a weird way, I think exercising your "pushback" muscle when it makes sense to do so can garner more respect from your colleagues. It shows that you're invested in your work and care about its quality and longevity.

Having the knowledge or the confidence to speak up when something doesn't makes sense wont happen overnight. Or at least it didn't for me. I wasn't really confident in pushing back on certain things up until a year or two ago. Additionally, as a fresh engineer you won't even know when something even _deserves_ pushback. Be that as it may, I write this so that you keep the option of saying **no** (when it makes sense) in your back pocket for when you _do_ have enough experience and you _do_ know what you're talking about.

## 5. Keep Track of Your Accomplishments

This is something i wish I started doing as soon as I entered the workforce.

## 6. Keep Track of Everything Else

- notes
- problems and how you fixed them

## 7. Don't Be Afraid to Tackle the Hard Things

## 8. Go All In

## 9. Clever Code != Good Code
