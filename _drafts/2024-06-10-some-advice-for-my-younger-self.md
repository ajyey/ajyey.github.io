This is a small list of things I would tell my younger self entering the workforce. While I don't claim to be an expert today, I think I've picked up some insights that would have been beneficial to my younger self at the start of his journey into the software engineering industry.

## 1. You Don't Need to Know Everything

When I first started studying computer science in college, I felt like I needed to know everything to land a job. Then, when I started my first job, I felt like I needed to master every new technology and framework to feel like a "real engineer." The reality is that you don't need to know everything.

That being said, I _do_ think it's beneficial to have a surface-level understanding of various areas within this field. Take a look at [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/), and you'll see that there's no shortage of areas within software engineering to learn about.

This field is unique in that it seemingly changes by the hour, with new technologies to learn springing into existence _all the time_. It's important to cultivate a mindset of continuous growth and learning, and equally important to know and accept that you won't know everything. And that's okay.

## 2. Learn `git`

One of the very first things you should learn is how to version control your code. I highly recommend learning `git`. Not only is it by far the most popular tool for version control, [overtaking others by a large margin](https://openhub.net/repositories/compare), but it can (and will) save you a lot of headache throughout your career. **I never write code without version control.**

If you learn the basics of `git`, you'll be able to handle the following scenarios:

- Delete a file by accident? [You can get it back using `git checkout`](https://4ddig.tenorshare.com/windows-recovery-solutions/git-restore-deleted-file.html).

- Want to stash a small change to use (i.e. apply) later? [`git stash` is your friend](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-stash)

- Have a fancy new feature you want to work on without affecting existing stable code? [Create a new branch](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches) and work on that feature worry free.

These scenarios scratch the surface of what you can accomplish. You can spend months learning all the ins and outs of `git`, but at the very least, learn the basics. Learn how to commit changes, push and pull from a remote, work with branches, etc. The importance of version control cannot be overstated.

## 3. Prioritize Your Health

This one is likely the most important tidbit out of this list. Yes, even more important than knowing how to use `git`.

Working as an engineer can be remarkably sedentary. It's very easy to slip into a routine of sitting at a desk for 8+ hours a day followed by more sitting on the couch, thereby not moving much at all. When I find myself slipping into a routine like this, I feel noticeably worse. My body tightens up. My back starts hurting. General motivation quickly wanes.

The solution is consistent exercise. You have to get your body moving to combat the sedentary lifestyle that comes with being stuck in front of a computer a large portion of the day. You should be doing something everyday to get your heart rate elevated and your body sweating. Exercise daily no matter what in some way, shape, or form. For bonus points, add a stretching and mobility routine. I feel like this portion took a turn towards general health advice, but I think it's important to mention.

As a bonus, I've found that not only do I feel much better when I'm exercising regularly, but I also tend to be much more motivated to excel in my work and personal projects. So not only will you be healthier, but you'll also trend towards being a better, productive engineer if that's your goal.

## 4. Don't Be Afraid to Say **No** <sub><sup>(within reason)</sup></sub>

This one is a little hard to do when you're fresh, possibly starting your first job, and don't know much.

I still think it's worth mentioning since saying "no" is an underutilized option that most people forget they have.

I wouldn't recommend flat out refusing to do something that your manager or team lead asks of you, but developing a "pushback" muscle as you gain more years of experience isn't a bad thing. In fact, I'd argue that it's a really good thing.

For example, I think being hit with an unrealistic deadline that would compromise quality is a good candidate for speaking up. Or maybe your team is using a specific technology for a task when a much better one exists. As a beneficial byproduct, conveying your (possibly) contradictory thoughts can lead to constructive, productive discussion within your team.

In a weird way, I think exercising your "pushback" muscle when it makes sense to do so can garner more respect from your colleagues. It shows that you're invested in your work and care about its quality and longevity.

Having the knowledge or the confidence to speak up when something doesn't makes sense won't happen overnight. Additionally, as a fresh engineer you won't even know when something even _deserves_ pushback. Be that as it may, I write this so that you keep the option of saying **no** (when it makes sense) in your back pocket for when you _do_ have enough experience and you _do_ know what you're talking about.

## 5. Keep Track of Your Accomplishments

Keeping a detailed record of your accomplishments helps you in many ways, from being able to advocate for yourself in performance reviews to keeping your resume is up to date.

I guarantee you will forget the many tasks and projects you've successfully completed over time. Maintaining a "brag document" that outlines accomplishments you're proud of is a good way to keep track of what you've done so you can reference it later. There's a great resource on brag documents [here](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/) that I highly recommend checking out. I wish I started doing this as soon as I entered the workforce.

**Pro tip**: Your brag document will help you have prepared answers and stories for the "Tell me about a time when..." or "Explain a past project..." questions that are common in interviews.

## 6. Start a Blog

Blogception :smile:

Starting a blog is a good way to showcase your technical prowess and keep an archive of your technical growth and experimentation over time. I wish I started writing earlier in my career. Even being able to look back at things like: 

- technical problems I encountered and solved
- what was going on in my life at that time
- technologies I've learned

..would have been very rewarding.

Even if no one but myself ever reads these posts, I think having concrete data (i.e. writing pieces) to track my progress over time as a constantly learning engineer is worthwhile.

## 8. Clever Code `!=` Good Code
