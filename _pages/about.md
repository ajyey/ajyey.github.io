I'm a software engineer with a passion for designing and building scalable, reliable backend systems. I'm currently working at [Ally Financial](https://www.ally.com/) as a [Principal Software Engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewjamesleonard/) building serverless APIs hosted in AWS. I'm also currently a graduate student at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), enrolled in [OMSCS](https://omscs.gatech.edu/), where I'm pursuing a Master's degree in computer science with a [specialization in computing systems](https://omscs.gatech.edu/specialization-computing-systems).

In my spare time, I like to build and contribute to open source projects to continue learning and growing as a software engineer.

Here are a few that I've recently built:

- [**`fastmail-masked-email`**](https://github.com/ajyey/fastmail-masked-email)
- [**`masked-email-manager`**](https://github.com/ajyey/masked-email-manager)

When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually at the gym :weight_lifting:, gaming :video_game:, or hanging out with my two dogs :dog: :dog:
